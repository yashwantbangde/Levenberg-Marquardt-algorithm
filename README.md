# Implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm from scratch

1. Initialize the parameters of the linear regression model: This involves setting the initial values of the parameters of the linear regression model. These parameters are typically denoted by beta and are used to predict the response variable y as a linear combination of the predictor variables x.

2. Compute the Jacobian matrix of the model at the current parameter values: The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives that describes how each element of the model output (i.e., the predicted y values) changes with respect to each element of the model input (i.e., the beta parameters). The Jacobian matrix is used to estimate the Hessian matrix in the next step.

3. Compute the approximation to the Hessian matrix using the Jacobian matrix: The Hessian matrix is a matrix of second partial derivatives that describes the curvature of the error function (i.e., the sum of squared residuals) at the current parameter values. The LM algorithm approximates the Hessian matrix by using the Jacobian matrix and a damping factor, which is used to avoid singular or ill-conditioned matrices.

4. Solve the normal equations to obtain the parameter update: The normal equations are a system of linear equations that can be used to solve for the parameter update that minimizes the error function. The LM algorithm solves these equations by adding the damping factor to the diagonal of the approximation to the Hessian matrix.

5. Update the parameters of the linear regression model: The parameter update obtained in the previous step is added to the current parameter values to obtain new parameter values. These new parameter values are used to compute a new predicted y values in the next iteration of the algorithm.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 until convergence: The algorithm iterates through steps 2-5 until the parameter updates become sufficiently small or the maximum number of iterations is reached. At each iteration, the algorithm updates the parameters and computes a new predicted y values based on the new parameter values.

By iteratively updating the parameters of the linear regression model and minimizing the error function, the LM algorithm is able to estimate the best-fit parameters for the model. These parameters can be used to make predictions on new data or to gain insight into the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable.
